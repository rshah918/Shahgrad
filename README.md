# Shahgrad
Shahgrad is a mathematical expression engine and ML library designed for building neural networks from scratch. It provides the ability to create and manipulate mathematical expressions, backprop gradients through the expression graphs, and includes a small neural net library with visualization capabilities for the neural net's mathematical expression graph.

Made this to better understand how pytorch/tensorflow work under the hood.
## Features

Mathematical Expression Engine: Create and manipulate mathematical expressions.
Gradient Backpropagation: Perform gradient backpropagation through the expressions for training neural networks.
Neural Net Library: Implement neural networks using the mathematical expressions as building blocks.
Expression Graph Visualization: Visualize the expression graph of neural networks for better understanding.
