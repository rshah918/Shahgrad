# Shahgrad
Shahgrad is a mathematical expression engine and ML library designed for building neural networks from scratch. It provides the ability to create and run mathematical expressions, backprop gradients through the expression graphs, and includes a lightweight neural net library. The library also offers visualization capabilities to explore the mathematical expression graph of any neural net.

Made this to better understand how pytorch/tensorflow work under the hood.
## Features

Mathematical Expression Engine: Create and manipulate mathematical expressions.
Gradient Backpropagation: Perform gradient backpropagation through the expressions for training neural networks.
Neural Net Library: Implement neural networks using the mathematical expressions as building blocks.
Expression Graph Visualization: Visualize the expression graph of neural networks for better understanding.
